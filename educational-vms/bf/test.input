%-                       Version 2, June 1991
%-
%- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
%- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
%- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
%- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
%-
%-                            Preamble
%-
%-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
%-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
%-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
%-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
%-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
%-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
%-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
%-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
%-your programs, too.
%-
%-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
%-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
%-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
%-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
%-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
%-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
%-
%-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
%-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
%-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
%-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
%-
%-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
%-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
%-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
%-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
%-rights.
%-
%-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
%-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
%-distribute and/or modify the software.
%-
%-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
%-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
%-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
%-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
%-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
%-authors' reputations.
%-
%-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
%-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
%-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
%-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
%-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
%-
%-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
%-modification follow.
%-
%-                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
%-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
%-
%-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
%-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
%-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
%-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
%-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
%-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
%-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
%-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
%-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
%-
%-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
%-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
%-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
%-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
%-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
%-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
%-
%-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
%-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
%-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
%-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
%-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
%-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
%-along with the Program.
%-
%-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
%-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
%-
%-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
%-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
%-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
%-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
%-
%-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
%-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
%-
%-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
%-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
%-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
%-    parties under the terms of this License.
%-
%-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
%-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
%-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
%-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
%-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
%-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
%-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
%-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
%-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
%-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
%-
%-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
%-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
%-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
%-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
%-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
%-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
%-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
%-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
%-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
%-
%-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
%-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
%-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
%-collective works based on the Program.
%-
%-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
%-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
%-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
%-the scope of this License.
%-
%-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
%-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
%-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
%-
%-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
%-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
%-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
%-
%-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
%-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
%-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
%-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
%-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
%-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
%-
%-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
%-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
%-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
%-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
%-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
%-
%-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
%-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
%-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
%-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
%-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
%-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
%-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
%-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
%-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
%-itself accompanies the executable.
%-
%-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
%-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
%-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
%-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
%-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
%-
%-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
%-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
%-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
%-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
%-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
%-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
%-parties remain in full compliance.
%-
%-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
%-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
%-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
%-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
%-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
%-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
%-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
%-the Program or works based on it.
%-
%-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
%-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
%-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
%-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
%-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
%-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
%-this License.
%-
%-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
%-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
%-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
%-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
%-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
%-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
%-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
%-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
%-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
%-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
%-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
%-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

%-                       Version 2, June 1991
%-
%- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
%- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
%- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
%- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
%-
%-                            Preamble
%-
%-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
%-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
%-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
%-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
%-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
%-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
%-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
%-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
%-your programs, too.
%-
%-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
%-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
%-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
%-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
%-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
%-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
%-
%-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
%-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
%-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
%-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
%-
%-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
%-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
%-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
%-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
%-rights.
%-
%-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
%-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
%-distribute and/or modify the software.
%-
%-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
%-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
%-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
%-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
%-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
%-authors' reputations.
%-
%-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
%-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
%-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
%-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
%-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
%-
%-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
%-modification follow.
%-
%-                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
%-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
%-
%-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
%-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
%-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
%-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
%-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
%-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
%-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
%-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
%-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
%-
%-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
%-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
%-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
%-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
%-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
%-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
%-
%-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
%-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
%-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
%-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
%-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
%-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
%-along with the Program.
%-
%-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
%-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
%-
%-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
%-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
%-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
%-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
%-
%-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
%-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
%-
%-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
%-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
%-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
%-    parties under the terms of this License.
%-
%-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
%-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
%-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
%-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
%-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
%-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
%-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
%-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
%-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
%-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
%-
%-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
%-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
%-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
%-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
%-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
%-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
%-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
%-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
%-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
%-
%-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
%-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
%-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
%-collective works based on the Program.
%-
%-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
%-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
%-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
%-the scope of this License.
%-
%-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
%-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
%-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
%-
%-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
%-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
%-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
%-
%-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
%-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
%-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
%-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
%-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
%-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
%-
%-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
%-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
%-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
%-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
%-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
%-
%-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
%-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
%-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
%-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
%-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
%-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
%-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
%-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
%-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
%-itself accompanies the executable.
%-
%-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
%-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
%-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
%-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
%-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
%-
%-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
%-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
%-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
%-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
%-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
%-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
%-parties remain in full compliance.
%-
%-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
%-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
%-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
%-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
%-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
%-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
%-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
%-the Program or works based on it.
%-
%-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
%-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
%-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
%-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
%-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
%-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
%-this License.
%-
%-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
%-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
%-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
%-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
%-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
%-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
%-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
%-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
%-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
%-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
%-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
%-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
%-
%-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
%-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
%-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
%-circumstances.
%-
%-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
%-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
%-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
%-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
%-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
%-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
%-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
%-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
%-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
%-impose that choice.
%-
%-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
%-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
%-
%-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
%-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
%-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
%-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
%-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
%-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
%-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
%-
%-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
%-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
%-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
%-address new problems or concerns.
%-
%-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
%-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
%-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
%-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free

%-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
show warranty
%-                            NO WARRANTY
%-
%-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
%-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
%-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
%-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
%-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
%-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
%-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
%-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
%-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
%-
%-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
%-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
%-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
%-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
%-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
%-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
%-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
%-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
%-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
