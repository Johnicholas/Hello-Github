This package contains version 0.02 of bfdb, an optimizing interpreter, 
debugger, and compiler for the BF programming language, bflen, a short 
utility to compute the length of BF programs, and bfref, a simple
reference interpreter for BF.  bfdb, bflen and bfref are written in C++, C,
and C, respectively.  Man pages are provided (as source) in bfdb.1, bflen.1,
and bfref.1.

Installation
------------

bfdb uses the GNU multiple precision library, libgmp.  You may use the supplied
makefile to build bfdb, bflen, and bfref. `make test' will test bfdb.  This 
test assumes that integers are 32 bits in length and will fail if this is not 
the case.

License
-------

bfdb is released under the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.  For a copy of
version 2 of the GPL, look at the file COPYING.
