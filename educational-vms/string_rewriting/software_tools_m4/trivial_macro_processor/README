This is me (Johnicholas) working through the trivial macro processor
that was presented at the beginning of chapter 8 of Software Tools by Kernighan and Plauger.

One refinement that I learned
(after writing it the wrong way first)
is that lookup deliberately searches backwards,
so that later definitions override earlier ones.

TODO:
Can I do anything interesting with this?
What if some of the implementation limits were lifted?
