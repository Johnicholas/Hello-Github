Leszek interpreter
==================

usage: leszek source-file

Here is the specification: http://esolangs.org/wiki/Leszek

Features
--------
All implemented operators are described in the specification and vice versa.

There are some limitations in this impementation:
- the source string can never be longer than 65536 characters
- value of any computed expression must not be longer than 1024 characters
- integer values are implemented using "int" type, which is usually 4-byte long
All of these limitations can be easily modified by editing the source.

Bugs
----
There is almost no syntax/error checking... Bad programs often segfault.

If you are a win/dos user, you have a problem, because a newline should be
one character long (so it can be used for example as a delimiter with \C)

There is an undocumented debug function (examine the source for more details).

Disclaimer
----------
There is no licence. You can do anything you want with these files,
but you can't sue me (no warranty, can explode, etc.). Be warned.
