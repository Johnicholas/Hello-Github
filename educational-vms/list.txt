Tiny (hundreds of loc) bytecode interpreters in C:
* Sean Barrett (buzzard)'s ioccc entry, a vm sufficient to bootstrap a forth.
* The Cult of Bound Variable's universal machine from ICFP 2006.
* Lennart Augustsson's 1996 ioccc entry, a vm that supports both a self-hosting interpreter and a compiler from a subset of C to bytecode.
* A bf interpreter by Daniel Cristofani
* tinyGP by Riccardo Poli -  a GP system based on a bytecode interpreter

Large "serious" bytecode interpreters:
* The truetype interpreter, used for font hinting.

Other possibilities:
* an older (and therefore smaller) version of lua
** possibly the version that Norman Ramsey forked
* tinypy (>1kloc)
* pymite (several kloc)
* tinyrb (several kloc)
* littlesmalltalk and derivatives like tumbleweed (>1kloc)
* Various languages by Darius Bacon such as tusl, wren, uts.
* Kragen Sittaker's calculusvaporis/cavosim.c, a simulator for his tiny cpu.
* Tom Jennings's Universal Machine simulator (but it's in perl - rewrite?)

Not exactly bytecode interpreters, but relevant:
* The garbage collector from Darius Bacon's ichbins.
* Ian Piumarta's id-objmodel/obj.h, polymorphism in 144 lines of C.
* the Fuun DNA machine from ICFP (a spec, but many people implemented it)
* the Leszek esolang, string-rewriting interpreter
* il4c and roseshank, a compiler and 4k demo respectively, by XMunkki
