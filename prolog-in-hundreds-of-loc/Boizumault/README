This directory contains the various Prolog interpreters developped in the
third part of the book : The implementation of Prolog, P. Boizumault, Princeton
University Press, 1993.

Each Directory corresponds respectively to the programs developped in Appendix
A (microCprolog), B (microWam), C (microPrologII) and D (microUtili).

The directory microEx contains examples that can be run independantly on each version.
Beware that the files ending with the digit 3 can only be executed with microPrologII
due to the use of the predicates dif and freeze.

Enjoy it and you can reach me in case of any problem at : boizu@ucoima.math-appli-uco.fr
