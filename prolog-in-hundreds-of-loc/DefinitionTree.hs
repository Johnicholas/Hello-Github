-- A model of the evaluation of logic programs (i.e., resolving Horn clauses)

-- The point is not to re-implement Prolog with all the conveniences
-- but to formalize evaluation strategies such as SLD, SLD-interleaving, 
-- and others.
-- The formalization is aimed at reasoning about termination and
-- solution sequences. See App A and B of the full FLOPS 2008 paper

		-- A logic var is represented by a pair of an integer
		-- and a list of `predicate marks' (which are themselves
		-- integers). Such an odd representation is needed to
		-- ensure the standardization apart: different instances
		-- of a clause must have distinctly renamed variables.
		-- Unlike Claessen, we get by without the state monad
		-- to generate unique variable names (labels). See the
		-- discussion and examples in the `tests' section below.
		-- Our main advantage is that we separate the naming of
		-- variables from the evaluation strategy. Evaluation
		-- no longer cares about generating fresh names, which
		-- notably simplifies the analysis of the strategies.
		-- Logic vars are typed, albeit phantomly.

-- Formulas 
-- A formula describes a finite or _infinite_ AND-OR tree
-- that encodes the logic-program clauses that may be needed to
-- evaluate a particular goal.
-- We represent a goal g(t1,...,tn) by a combination of the goal
-- g(X1,...,Xn), whose arguments are distinct fresh logic
-- variables, and a substitution {Xi=ti}. For a goal
-- g(X1,...,Xn), a |Formula| encodes all the clauses of the
-- logic program that could possibly prove g, in their order. Each
-- clause 
--   g(t1,...,tn) :- b1(t11,...,t1m), ...
-- is represented by the (guarding) substitution {Xi=ti, Ykj=tkj}
-- and the sequence of the goals bk(Yk1,...,Ykm) in the body. 
-- Each of these goals is again encoded as a |Formula|. 
-- All variables in the clauses are renamed to ensure the standardization apart.
--
-- Our trees are similar to Antoy's definitional trees, used to encode
-- rewriting rules and represent control strategies in
-- term-rewriting systems and _functional logic_ programming.
-- However, in definitional trees, function calls can be nested, 
-- and patterns are linear.
--
-- The translation from Prolog is straightforward; the first step
-- is to re-write clauses so that the arguments of each goal are 
-- logic variables:
-- A fact 
--      g(term).
-- is converted to
--      g(X) :- X = term.
--
-- A clause
--      g(term) :- g1(term1), g2(term2).
-- is converted to
--      g(X) :- X = term, _V1 = term1, g1(_V1), _V2=term2, g2(_V2).

-- We should be able to examine a term and determine if it is a variable
-- or a constructor (represented by an integer) applied to a sequence of
-- zero or more terms. Conversely, given a constructor (represented by an
-- integer) and a list of terms-children we should be able to build a term.
-- The two operations must satisfy the laws:
--   either id build . classify === id
--   classify . build === Right

-- Encoding of variable names to ensure standardization apart.
-- A clause such as genu(X) or add(X,Y,Z) may appear in the tree
-- (infinitely) many times. We must ensure that each instance uses distinct
-- logic variables. To this end, we name variables by a pair (Int, VStack)
-- whose first component is the local label of a variable within a clause.
-- VStack is a path from the root of the tree to the current occurrence
-- of the clause in the tree. Each predicate along the path is represented
-- by an integer label (0 for genu, 1 for add, 2 for mul, etc). 
-- To `pass' arguments to a clause, we add to the current substitution
-- the bindings for the variables of that clause. See the genu' example
-- below: whereas (0,h) is the label of the variable X in the current
-- instance of genu, (0,genu_mark:h) is X in the callee.
