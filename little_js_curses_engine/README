To run this, you need a Linux machine with libv8 installed.

To install libv8, something like 'sudo apt-get install libv8' ought to work, depending on your distribution.

Then 'make js_curses' ought to make a binary named 'js_curses'.

Then './js_curses game_loop.js' ought to show a little roguelike-ish thing (wasd to move, control-C to quit).

The setup / draw / update structure was taken from ippa's JawsJS.
The game loop was based on Steven Fuerst's 512-byte roguelike.
